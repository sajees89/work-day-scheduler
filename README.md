# Third-Party APIs: Workday Scheduler

## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for specific hours of the workday. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This application must utilize the client-provided CSS style sheet, as well as Moment.js, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
